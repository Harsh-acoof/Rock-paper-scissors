Rock Paper Scissors made in Spring Boot is a web-based implementation of the classic hand game,
where users can play against a computer or other players. Using Spring Boot as the backend framework,
this application handles game logic, user sessions, and real-time interactions. 
It provides a simple, intuitive interface to choose between rock, paper, or scissors and displays the results of each round, including the winner.
This project demonstrates the integration of Java with web technologies, enabling a smooth and scalable gameplay experience.
